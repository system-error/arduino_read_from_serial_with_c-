In this code the only thing I want to share at least for now is the code in c# and an approach that I have created a way to send from a combobox and read from a sesnor of arduino with windows form using threading because without threading the window freezes and I cannot change the list or close the connection. So I am sharing the code of form because I want to help other people (maybe with the same problem) in case someone wants a simple way. For me worked 100%!!

The result!!
